       # 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end data science project focused on analyzing and predicting customer churn using a real-world dataset (`BankChurners.csv`).

## 📁 Files Included

- `EDA_file.ipynb`: This notebook contains detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer demographics, credit usage, transaction patterns, and churn behavior.
- `Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`: This notebook implements and evaluates multiple **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting) to predict customer churn.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Understand key patterns and trends in customer churn using EDA.
- Identify high-risk segments based on demographics and usage.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Use performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC** for model comparison.

## 📦 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:

- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC-AUC Score
- Feature Importance (for tree-based models)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab (for development)
